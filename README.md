# GESTURE-BASED-DRAWING-APPLICATION
A real-time hand-gesture controlled drawing application built using MediaPipe and OpenCV. The system tracks hand landmarks to allow users to draw, erase, select colors, choose shapes, save drawings, and undo/redo actions—all without touching the screen. Includes a modern bottom toolbar with hover-based interaction and a live camera preview.
